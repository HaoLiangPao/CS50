# A portfolio page template
#### Video Demo:  [https://youtu.be/h-VVIaRieiQ](portfolio page)
#### Description:
[My code may be too big to submit, It is in my github, and I think the code submission is optional as well. So I will not include the code here, Hope you can understand]
1. Welcome page lists my specialties
   1. I used JavaScript to have the typing animation for three identities.
   2. I made the top nav and bottom contact component reusable for all pages.
   3. Sass was used to write css code more efficient, also created some reusable css styles
2. About page list my experience (presented in a timeline)
   1. Timeline uses a JavaScript listener which listen for scrolling position and then triggers a css animation which bring the timeline card from invisible to visible.
3. Project page leads to many small project I created and deployed on another host
   1. Small projects are deployed through Heroku, where the portfolio page is hosted on a virtual machine (EC2 AWS)
   2. SSL was configured for the portfolio page as well.


#### Technology:
1. HTML, CSS, JavsScript
2. REACT.js
3. Node.js
4. AWS & Heroku

#### Small Projects:
I have tried out various specs of HTML, CSS, JS through completing these projects. I transformed some of them into react app as well for practice purposes. However, I got the idea from a Udemy Course, which you can go there and search (Small Projects with Traversy Media)
1. FormValidator
2. MovieSeatBooking

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
